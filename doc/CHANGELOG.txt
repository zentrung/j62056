v1.2 10-Jan-2014
----------------
- read now throws TimeoutException so it can be distinguished from
  other IOExceptions
- minor performance improvement with charset
- prepared build file for upload to central maven repository

v1.1.1 10-Dec-2013
------------------
- Moved sample ReadMeter application into library and improved its
  documentation

v1.1.0 05-Dec-2013
------------------
- fixed parsing of unit of last data set (thanks to Gerrie de Jager)
- changed timeout behaviour. The timeout is now the maximum time that
  the master will listen for the next byte. It used to be the maximum
  time the whole read process may take. The default timeout was
  changed from 30s to 5s.
- a timeout will now cause an IOException to be thrown instead of
  returning null
- removed disabling of baud rate change and instead added a delay
  parameter for the baud rate change. This is needed for most USB to
  serial adapters. (thanks to Gerrie de Jager)
- the first data set in the list returned by read() will now contain
  the meter identification as received in the Identification Message
  from the slave.

v1.0.0 15-Nov-2013
------------------
- first version
