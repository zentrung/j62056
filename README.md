j62056 is a Java library implementing an IEC 62056-21 mode C master.  It can be used to read metering data from slaves such as gas, water, heat, or electricity meters. The software has been tested under Linux and Windows.
j62056 is licensed under the LGPL version 2.1 or later.

The library includes an application that reads a given meter and prints the received data to stdout. This source code of this application can be used as an example on how to use the library to write your own master/client. See the README.txt file inside the distribution for further details.
